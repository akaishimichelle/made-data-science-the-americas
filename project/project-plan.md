## Title

Productivity and Poverty level trends among women in the USA: A case study of patterns from the 20th and 21st centuries

## Main Question
How poverty levels among different women groups were affected by changes in productivity levels across 2 centuries?
What are the difference in trends across the years (1980-1990 vs 2010-2020)?

Follow-up questions:
What are the key highlights in the two decades from different centuries?
What are the differing trends among black, white and hispanic women groups?


## Description
Statistics have shown us that productivity and hourly compensaion has direct correlation with povertly levels i.e. rise in productivity 
among workers, increases the poverty threshold. Therefore, it introduced significant shifts influenced by social, economic, and policy changes. Even in the USA, in the late 20th century, although trends did shift towards women empowerment, they still had limited access to education, employment, and financial independence. This contributed to high number of families living below the poverty line. In the 21st century, increased educational and professional opportunities for women contributed to economic independence and lower poverty rates. 

This case study aims to compare the trends for poverty and productivty levels among women in the USA for two time periods 1950-1960 and 2010-2020. It also brings insights into the patterns within different women demographics based on race (white, black and hispanic).
