What are some major patterns based on gender for these parameters? 


## Description
This case study explores the economic dynamics of the USA by examining trends in median compensation, productivity, and poverty-level wages over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. The study primarily investigates how changes in productivity and median compensation have influenced annual poverty level wages during two distinct time periods: the 1980-1990s and the 2010-2020s. Additionally, the study delves into patterns based on gender, seeking to understand how these economic factors have differently impacted men and women over time. Through this analysis, the study aims to uncover significant trends and insights into the evolving economic landscape of the USA.
