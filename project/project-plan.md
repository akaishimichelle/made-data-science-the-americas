## Title

Tackling Femicide through education in Latin America: Do countries with higher education inquality rates have lower femicide cases?

## Main Question
Do countries with higher education inquality rates have lower femicide cases?

## Description
Latin America has a history of violence due to multiple factors including drugs, cartels, civil unrest and political corruption..etc
Among the many existing issues which plague their society, one of them is: Femicide. 

Femicide is defined as "the killing of a woman or a girl, in particular by a man and on account of her gender."  It is not just another form of violence but is an intentional murder based on gender, instilled in misogyny and patriarchal systems. 

This study aims to find patterns between disparity in education levels and femicide rates in the last decade in Latin America, providing insights into how we, as a society, may tackle this problem by giving everyone equal opportunities for education.
